# Client Side Programming - JavaScript Operators and User Interaction

This JavaScript program demonstrates the use of arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators, as well as user interaction with alerts, prompts, and conditionals.

## Code Explanation

The program is divided into five parts:

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.

### 2. **Comparison Operators**
   - Demonstrates comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, `!==`) to compare two numbers and log the results.

### 3. **Logical Operators**
   - Uses logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to perform boolean logic with variables like `isSunny` and `isWeekend`.

### 4. **Assignment Operators**
   - Demonstrates assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`) to update the value of the `score` variable.

### 5. **User Interaction**
   - Uses `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` to interact with the user.
   - If the user confirms they are human and provides their name and age, these values are logged to the console.

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `js_operators.js`.
2. Open the file in any web browser's developer console or save it as an HTML file and open it in a browser.
3. The program will perform arithmetic operations and interact with the user through prompts and alerts.

## Example Output

```
Addition result: 30
Subtraction result: -10
Multiplication result: 200
Division result: 0.5
Modulus result: 10
Power result: 100000000000000000000

Is num1 greater than num2: false
Is num1 less than num2: true
Is num1 less than or equal to num2: true
Is num1 greater than or equal to num2: false
Is num1 the same type and value as num2: false
Is num1 not equal to num2: true

Sunny AND Weekend? false
Sunny OR Weekend? true
Sunny? false

Updated score after += 10: 60
Updated score after -= 5: 55
Updated score after *= 2: 110
```

## Description

This program covers various JavaScript operators and demonstrates user interaction techniques. It allows the user to perform arithmetic operations, check conditions, and interact via alerts and prompts in a browser environment.
