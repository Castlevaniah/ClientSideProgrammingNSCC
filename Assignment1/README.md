## Code Explanation

The program is divided into four parts:

### 1. **Variables, Data Types & Type Casting**
   - Declares variables (`studentName`, `studentAge`, `isEnrolled`) and displays their values.
   - Demonstrates type casting by converting `studentAge` to a string and displaying the change in type.

### 2. **Operators & User Interaction**
   - Takes two numbers from the user via `prompt()` and performs arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
   - Displays the results on the web page.

### 3. **Conditional Execution**
   - Prompts the user for their age and checks if they are eligible to vote (18 or older).
   - Displays the result based on the user's input.

### 4. **Loops**
   - Uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
   - Uses a `do-while` loop to prompt the user for a number greater than 10, repeating until a valid number is entered.

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `js_fundamentals.html`.
2. Open the file in any web browser.
3. The program will display output directly on the page as you interact with the prompts.

## Example Output

```
Student Name: Prince Vegeta
Student Age: 25 (number)
Enrolled: true
Student Age after conversion: 25 (string)

Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Addition: 8
Subtraction: 2
Multiplication: 15
Division: 1.6667
Modulus: 2

Enter your age: 20
You are eligible to vote!

Numbers from 1 to 10: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Enter a number greater than 10: 12
Valid number entered: 12
```

## Description

This program covers fundamental JavaScript concepts, demonstrating how to handle data types, perform basic calculations, make decisions based on user input, and repeat actions using loops. It provides an interactive experience using the `document.write()` method and `prompt()` for input.
